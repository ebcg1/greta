* note is: `Lost braces in \itemize; \value handles \item{}{} directly`. I cannot seem to work out how to resolve this note, and in searching for this, I have found many other R packages having this NOTE on CRAN checks, e.g., https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_vegan.html. So I'm not sure if this is a specific quirk?
